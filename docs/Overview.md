# Rönd

Rönd is responsible for handling authorization rules, useful to restrict access to specific resources and API.
While it support expressive authorization rules possible on the request data it also provides primitives for implementing your [RBAC solution](#Rönd-and-rbac).

Rönd uses [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) as security engine for validating authorization rules.

## Rönd installation

Rönd is generally used as sidecar container, Rönd will intercept all the incoming traffic, apply authorization rules and, if they pass, forward the traffic to your application service.

To define which APIs are exposed by your service Rönd accepts an OpenAPI 3 specification that can be provided either via file or via API (in this case Rönd will contact your service to fetch the OAS and use it to configure itself).

For further details on how to configure it, check out the configuration page.

>  Rönd can also be used in standalone mode, in this scenario services must explicit contact it to perform authorization rule evaluation. More on this in the configuration page.


## Rönd and RBAC

In addition to simple request-based authorization rules, Rönd provides the means for implementing a full-fledged RBAC solution; it uses MongoDB to store Roles and Bindings and allows you to write policies on user roles permissions and bindings.

## Rönd capabilities

Rönd evaluated policy can be used to perform three different actions:

1. allow or block API invocations
1. generate queries to filter data (currently supported syntax is MongoDB) 
1. modify the response payload (only supported for JSON bodies)
